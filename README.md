# Corn yield prediction in Kenia

This fictional project was developed as a midterm evaluation for the Machine Learning Zoomcamp offered by Data Talks Club. Method and objectives were defined for educational purposes only, so I can show the knowledge appropiated during the firsts part of the training. 

The current project simulates a real scenario of information gathering to support effective political decision-making in a mayor's office in Kenya, aiming to ensure food security in the region.

## Problem statement
This could be understood in two leves: a business problem and a technical problem. 

### _Business problem:_
Certain region in Kenya has experienced rapid population growth over the past decade in an underdeveloped economic environment. The social group living in this region considers _corn_ as the preferred base for most typical dishes; however, the low level of precipitation threatens sufficient production in the coming years. The Mayor's Office seeks to make the best decisions to ensure food security. That’s why the managing team at the political office needs to know how corn production can be improved and the key variables affecting it.

### _Technical problem:_
As a Machine Learning engineer, I am tasked with building a model that not only predicts the amount of corn produced in that county in Kenya but also helps decision makers at the mayor's office organize resources for optimized corn production. To achieve this goal, the model construction explores data collected from various plantations, identifying several useful variables such as the gender of the plantation leader, the size of the household, and the amount of fertilizer used in corn production, among others. This model is implemented in a cloud solution that serves the model for future use and insights extraction, enhancing its reliability, readability, and security.

## Solution proposed
The engineering solution proposed was built over a `model` with a reliabity of ... This model was selected after performing a profound Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) where missing values, univariate distribuitions and feature importance analysis were made. Extensive EDA can be found [here](https://github.com/bizzaccelerator/corn-yield-prediction/blob/main/notebook.ipynb).

The data used in this project was obtained for free from kagle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/japondo/corn-farming-data). However, a copy of the referred data is added to this repository for convenience. 

## How to run the project.
