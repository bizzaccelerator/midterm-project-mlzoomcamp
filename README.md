# Corn yield prediction in Kenia

This fictional project was developed as a midterm project for the Machine Learning Zoomcamp offered by Data Talks Club. Method and objectives were defined for educational purposes only, so I can show the knowledge appropiated during the firsts part of the training. 

The current project simulates a real escenario of information gathering for proper political decision making in a mayor's office of Kenia.
