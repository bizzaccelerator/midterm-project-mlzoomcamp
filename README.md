# Corn yield prediction in Kenia

This fictional project was developed as a midterm evaluation for the Machine Learning Zoomcamp offered by Data Talks Club. Method and objectives were defined for educational purposes only, so I can show the knowledge appropiated during the firsts part of the training. 

The current project simulates a real scenario of information gathering to support effective political decision-making in a mayor's office in Kenya, aiming to ensure food security in the region.

## Problem statement
This could be understood in two leves: a business problem and a technical problem. 

### _Business problem:_
Certain region in Kenya has experienced rapid population growth over the past decade in an underdeveloped economic environment. The social group living in this region considers _corn_ as the preferred base for most typical dishes; however, the low level of precipitation threatens sufficient production in the coming years. The Mayor's Office seeks to make the best decisions to ensure food security. That’s why the managing team at the political office needs to know about corn production over the coming months and the key variables affecting it.

### _Technical problem:_
According to the business problem, as a Data engineer, I'm required to identify and extract valuable data about the different players transactions at 500.000 Euros or higher, and the weather during the day when the transaction was executed, both from free sources available online. After that, it’s necessary to process and to clean raw data extracted, so a visualization tool can be made available to the decision takers at any time. All that, in a cloud solution that improve reliability, readability and safeness of the data at hand. 

## Solution proposed
The engineering

The data used in this project was obtained for free from kagle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/japondo/corn-farming-data). However, a copy of the referred data is added to this repository for convenience.
